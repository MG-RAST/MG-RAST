    <description>Coding regions within the sequences are predicted using FragGeneScan, an ab-initio prokaryotic gene calling algorithm. Using a hidden Markov model for coding regions and non-coding regions, this step identifies the most likely reading frame and translates nucleotide sequences into amino acids sequences. The predicted genes, possibly more than one per fragment, are called features.</description>

    <description>Sequences are pre-screened using usearch for at least 70% identity to ribosomal sequences and then clustered at 97% identity using UCLUST. The clustering process does not remove any sequences but instead makes the similarity search step easier. Following the search, the original reads are loaded into MG-RAST for retrieval on-demand.</description>
