genome that is of special interest. Features may be spread across
multiple DNA sequences (contigs) of a genome, but never across more
than one genome. Each feature in the database has a unique
ID that functions as its ID in this table.
Normally a Feature is just a single contigous region on a contig.
Features have types, and an appropriate choice of available types
allows the support of protein-encoding genes, exons, RNA genes,
binding sites, pathogenicity islands, or whatever.

It has the following fields:

=over 4


=item feature_type

Code indicating the type of this feature. Among the
codes currently supported are "peg" for a protein encoding
gene, "bs" for a binding site, "opr" for an operon, and so
forth.


=item source_id

ID for this feature in its original source (core)
database


=item sequence_length

Number of base pairs in this feature.


=item function

Functional assignment for this feature. This will
often indicate the feature's functional role or roles, and
may also have comments.
