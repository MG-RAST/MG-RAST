a specific reaction. A reaction involves many compounds, and a
compound can be involved in many reactions. The reagent
describes the use of the compound by a specific reaction.
It has the following fields:

=over 4


=item stoichiometry

Number of molecules of the compound that participate
in a single instance of the reaction. For example, if a
reaction produces two water molecules, the stoichiometry of
water for the reaction would be two. When a reaction is
written on paper in chemical notation, the stoichiometry is
the number next to the chemical formula of the
compound. The value is negative for substrates and positive
for products.


=item cofactor

TRUE if the compound is a cofactor; FALSE if it is a major
component of the reaction.


=item compartment_index

Abstract number that groups this reagent into a
compartment. Each group can then be assigned to real
compartments when doing comparative analysis.


=item transport_coefficient

Number of reagents of this type transported.
A positive value implies transport into the reactions
default compartment; a negative value implies export
to the reagent's specified compartment.
