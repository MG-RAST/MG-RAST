functional roles present in the Features of a single Genome.  The roles are part
of a designated subsystem, and the fids associated with each role are included in the row,
That is, a row amounts to an instance of a subsystem as it exists in a specific, designated
genome.

It has the following fields:

=over 4


=item curated

This flag is TRUE if the assignment of the molecular
machine has been curated, and FALSE if it was made by an
automated program.


=item region

Region in the genome for which the machine is relevant.
Normally, this is an empty string, indicating that the machine
covers the whole genome. If a subsystem has multiple machines
for a genome, this contains a location string describing the
region occupied by this particular machine.
